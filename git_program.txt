my git program will have 10 stages / levels it will start with basics which
will be exercised systematically until muscle memory fully developed.

how to practice?

everyday?  eat least 3 times a week.
brain needs some time between exercises.  material has got to be repeated few
times before it becomes automatic and fast process.
when we lern something we have to perform it very slow. at 30bpm.  this is
because our concies attencion is involved in process.  after repetitve concies
practice whole procedure becomes memorized in brain and it performs its
partical action mechanically 'without thinking about it' it is able to do this
much faster then in concius mode.

first thing at each session is tuning the instrument.
find high open string e (one at the bottom) and ensure it is correct pitch.
there is folder tuned strings compare and also check with tuner.
if your guitar is wrong pitch then all your learning/exercising will be canter
    productive. ie you will be confusing your brain. this is why its important 
    to make sure its tuned correct. every exercise will be adjusting your ear
    and brain to different pitches.  you will become more sensitive with time.
as part of ear training you should be able to recognize note and able to find
them on freatboad and write them down on clif. ear training takes time. so at
first dont worry if all notes/pitches sound similar and you cannot tell which
one is which.  after some time of exercising with instrument you will find it
easier to recognize your guitar went of tune.  
there is few git tuners available with source code. this programs are quite
acurate and are able to recognize pitch of many different instruments.
practice with them. you can also use them to find out key of your fav song.

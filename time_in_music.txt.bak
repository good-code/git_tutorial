time time time ....

so lets contemplate time for a while becouse time is very importand
in music.  English value their time. Time is money they say somethimes.
We hate to repeat becouse it waists our time .. that is why we record
it. We really got less time that we think lets say I'm 37y old now all 
left is 20 maybe 30y left that is very optimistic asumption that 
everything is going to be allright no accidents or sickness.  In this 
optimistic asumption as what possibly could go wrong when improvising 
trough life all I got left is 30y that is not much as I've already lived
trough 37y and it all happend so fast I dont even know when it all
happened.  within this 20 years I'd put the most important things I have
to do before I die.  

how long does it take to learn to play guitar?
depends how good is your guitar program and how frequently you practice.
if everyday you should be able to play your first song within 3 months 
time without mistakes.  so after 1 year you are able to release whole
album usually 5 > and < 15 songs.
bcouse next song is probably doable in less then 3 months. 
but the first one is the worst one.

how to distribute time for daily practice (1h)?
at first its haotic but then it becomes clockwork
1 min for tuning
12 minutes for scale wormup
12 minutes for rhythm exercises
12 min for ear training
12 min freatboard trainging
1 min just in case you went wrong with timeing

This planning is optimistic, if you did not mastered one fragment entarly 
you will have to come back to this later.  sometimes cord is difficult to
hold and we developed irrytation to it, then its best to leave it for a 
while and make another attempt later on focusing on easier chords for now.


first month you should learn c scale:
chords c d g 
scale up and down with each note said loud
basic down sturms rhythm even spaces
each sound you make should be same loudness!
when learning chords you have to with time get read of buzzing strings 
when holding chord,  with time pain in fingertips will disapear and clean
sound will be produced. practice with pick and get the best sound of your
instrument for each chord.


second month a min, and pentatonic scale
chords a amin a7 e b b7


third month:
chords bar F bar D bar C

I wonder atm if this is doable to learn all of this in one month.

I once asked myself where do I suck the most? rhythm? 
this is what I have to practice more than anything else.

start rhythm exercises early, all you need is few chords and metronome.
I've included some waves I use as metronome when practising, I also recommend
to install metronome app.

after music theory is digested and understood, once you've chosen your key and
notes recepture, for now just to start say c d g (easiest one to practice with).  
there has to be rhythm to every piece of music. and rhythm is something I
could not get naturally.  I though I got it right but I really got it wrong
the first time.  I was plaing too fast the easier part then slowing down on
more complex fragments then speeding up again .. and the whole thing sounded
horrible. thing is we don't always realise we play it wrong.  sometimes in our
head it is ok, but if recorded and then listened to it turns up to be wrong.

so few rhythm patterns to practice with are:

down    down     down    down  

down    up       down    up 

down    down     up      down     down     up

so try to play this with c d g cords at 60bpm for 3 min. and record yourself.
then review what you've recorded critically listening to yourself.
make sure each chord is same loud, same length.

important thing to notice about rhythm is that to every sound there is 
also fragment of silence. just like note on the clif and in music has length.
half note whole note.  silence after note also has length.  we call them
rests.

so muting (palm mutting, .... mutting ) technic allows us to control length of
c chord and length of silence after c chord. then length of d and length of 
silence after d cord.

down mute down mute down mute down mute
